\begin{abstract}
In the same spirit of the original BAR paper, the idea is to find the minimum variance solution
of the free energy difference estimator with respect to the weight functions.

\section{introduction}

The quantity of interest is the free energy difference between the two end points:

\begin{align}
\Delta A_{02} = \Delta A_{01} + \Delta A_{12}
\end{align}
where $\Delta A_{ij} \equiv A_i - A_j$ is the difference between two ensembles.

For now, let's introduce two weight functions $w_{01}$ and $w_{12}$ for the neighboring ensembles.
(We could also introduce $w_{02}$ and combine different estimators for $\Delta A_{02}$. Not included here.)
Following the same derivation of BAR paper, we have

\begin{align}
\Delta A_{02} = \log\left<w_{01} e^{-u_1}\right>_0 - \log\left<w_{01}e^{-u_0}\right>_1
              + \log\left<w_{12} e^{-u_2}\right>_1 - \log\left<w_{12}e^{-u_1}\right>_2
\end{align}

Note that the second and third terms are not statistically independent.
If we ignore their covariance, then the variance of $\Delta A_{02}$ would simply be the sum of
the variances of $\Delta A_{01}$ and $\Delta A_{12}$, and we can use the BAR result directly for the weight functions.
The existence of an extra covariance term tells us that applying the 2-ensemble BAR formula for 01 and 12 separately is not optimal.

\section{covariance term}
I will use the following two formula without proof

\begin{align}
Var[f(X)-g(X)] &= Var[f(X)] + Var[g(X)] + 2Cov[f(X), g(X)] \\
Cov[f(X), g(X)] &= f'(\left<X\right>)g'(\left<X\right>) Var[X]
\end{align}
where $X$ is a random variable, and $\left<X\right>$ is its expectation value with respect to an ensemble.

The first one is trivial. The second one can be easily derived by expansion to second order.

Recall in our case

\begin{align}
f(X) =& \log\left<w_{12} e^{-u_2}\right>_1 \\
g(X) =& \log\left<w_{01}e^{-u_0}\right>_1
\end{align}

Similar to the variance derivation in my blog post, the covariance is given by

\begin{align}
Cov[f(X), g(X)] = \frac{1}{N_1}\sqrt{\left(\frac{\left<w_{12}^2 e^{-2u_2}\right>_1 }{\left<w_{12} e^{-u_2}\right>_1^2 } - 1\right)\left(\frac{\left<w_{01}^2e^{-2u_0}\right>_1}{\left<w_{01}e^{-u_0}\right>_1^2} - 1\right)}
\end{align}


\section{overall variance}

Collecting all 4 variance terms and the covariance term, we have

\begin{align}
Var[\Delta A_{02}] =& \frac{\left<w_{01}|C_{01}+C_{10}|w_{01}\right>}{\left<w_{01}|B_{01}\right>\left<B_{01}|w_{01}\right>}
            + \frac{\left< w_{12}|C_{12} + C_{21} |w_{12} \right>}{\left<w_{12}|B_{12} \right>\left<B_{12}|w_{12} \right>} \\
            &+ 2\sqrt{\left(\frac{\left<w_{01}|C_{10}|w_{01}\right>}{\left<w_{01}|B_{01}\right>\left<B_{01}|w_{01}\right>} -\frac{1}{N_1}\right)
                     \left(\frac{\left< w_{12}|C_{12} |w_{12} \right>}{\left<w_{12}|B_{12} \right>\left<B_{12}|w_{12} \right>} -\frac{1}{N_1}\right)}
            - \frac{2}{N_1} - \frac{1}{N_0} - \frac{1}{N_2}
\end{align}
where the bra-ket notations are
\begin{align}
\left|B_{ij} \right> &= e^{-u_i - u_j} \\
\left|w_{ij} \right> &= w_{ij} \\
C_{ij} &= \frac{Q_i}{N_i} e^{-2u_j - u_i}
\end{align}

The next step would be taking derivatives to $\left|w_{01}\right>$ and $\left|w_{12}\right>$ to pin down their forms.
